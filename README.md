# Just Another Commons Library, Eh? (JACLE)

## Overview

This is a common base library with minimum dependencies that augments the basic JDK. Think Google's Guava. The modules include:

__commons__

*   The main base library

__commons-test__

*   A library specifically intended for use in unit testing (to be included at "test" scope)

__commons-unit-tests__

*   The unit tests for commons (happens to use commons-test, so it was broken out). This is not intended for consumption by other products.
